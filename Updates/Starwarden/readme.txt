***The Starwarden***
V1.0.0

For as long as you’ve known, the stars are all that reach beyond your vision in the station you’ve been assigned. 
You know of nothing else. So it makes perfect sense, then, that the celestial warden and organizer of the constellations 
would reach down to you, human, in your solitude.

For Ghost Jam 2024!

User guide:
- Stars have different behaviors! Pet them or feed them to encourage it, and punch them to discourage it.
- The warden might give you a few... pop quizzes.
